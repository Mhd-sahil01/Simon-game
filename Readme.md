### how to play ?
=> White flash (computer move)
=> Green flash (user move)

In this Simon Game, your goal is to remember and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors. The game begins when you click the Start button. The computer will show you the first move by flashing one of the colored buttons — this is shown using a white flash, which indicates a computer move. Once the computer finishes showing the sequence, it’s your turn to respond. During your move, when you click a button, it will flash green — this green flash simply means the user has made a move. You must repeat the exact sequence the computer showed, in the correct order. Each time you successfully complete the sequence, the game progresses to the next level, and the computer adds one more color to the sequence, making it more challenging. The level number updates accordingly so you can track your progress. The game continues to build until you make a mistake — then it ends and you can restart it. It's a fun test of memory, focus, and reflexes!
