                In this Simon Game, your goal is to remember and repeat an ever-growing sequence of colors. The game
                begins
                when you click the Start button. The computer will show you the first move by flashing one of the
                colored
                buttons — this is shown using a white flash, which indicates a computer move. Once the computer finishes
                showing the sequence, it’s your turn to respond. During your move, when you click a button, it will
                flash
                green — this green flash simply means the user has made a move. You must repeat the exact sequence the
                computer showed, in the correct order. Each time you successfully complete the sequence, the game
                progresses
                to the next level, and the computer adds one more color to the sequence, making it more challenging. The
                level number updates accordingly so you can track your progress. The game continues to build until you
                make
                a mistake — then it ends and you can restart it. It's a fun test of memory, focus, and reflexes!
